## SimpleJavaBlockChain
This example is to illustrate the basic working of a blockchain concept.
I've use rudimentary java with common libs to create how the block is created and what are the different attributes 
it will accept.
This by no means is a complete block on a say bitcoin or a ripple etc , but to get our understanding going.
I did not use any blockchain frameworks for this illustration.
In the code if you change even a character in the block initialization process and rerun the program , notice the hascode 
generated is completely different; This is the primary principle of immutability that a block chain provides in each 
of its block
